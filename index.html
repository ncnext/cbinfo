    <h2>Who is the Real Cherie Berry?</h2>
    <p>She wants you to think she's a friendly <a href="http://clclt.com/theclog/archives/2013/02/25/cherie-berry-the-predator-lurking-in-our-elevators">"elevator lady."</a></p>
    <p>But who is she, really?</p>
   <p>Cherie Berry doesn't believe North Carolina should even <a href="http://aflcionc.org/nc-labor-commissioner-wants-to-abolish-the-minimum-wage/">have a minimum wage.</a>
   </p>
   <p>
     She's supposed to be the state's chief advocate for workers, but here's what she really cares about: 
     
     <a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/903dec_4aa9f490029f457482c5a841df7310e1.pdf">"scaling back many of the burdensome regulations that strangle our business... I fight a constant battle with the Obama administration's Labor Department"</a>
   </p>
   
   <h2>The Elevator Lady Gives Workers the Shaft</h2>
   <p>She's been investigated repeatedly. Here's what we've learned:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>She <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article38692302.html">rarely forces payments from companies that cheat workers</a>
      </li>
     <li>her <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article38692302.html">Wage and Hour program is biased against employees in favor of employers</a>
      </li>
<li>an audit of Berry's NCDOL revealed <a href="http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2010/09/29/state-labor-dept-gets-harsh-critique">misclassification and downplaying of the seriousness of safety violations</a> in workplaces
      </li>
<li>Cherie Berry <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/article38905860.html">doesn’t see her mission as protecting workers; she sees it as protecting business, even when workers are getting shortchanged. </a>Time and again, her department has fallen short on investigations of unpaid wages...
      </li>
<li>Under Berry, <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article18291656.html">NCDOL has been undercounting the number of workers who die on the job in North Carolina every year</a></li>
   </ul>
   
<h2>The Elevator Lady in Her Own Words</h2>

     <ul>
       <li>She <a href="http://www.journalpatriot.com/news/berry-relishes-independence-from-u-s-labor-department/article_2ed9b74c-c688-11e4-93bb-3b2668049c45.html">cherishes “small little victories” over federal labor officials</a> because she <a href="http://www.journalpatriot.com/news/berry-relishes-independence-from-u-s-labor-department/article_2ed9b74c-c688-11e4-93bb-3b2668049c45.html">wants the federal government to get off her back</a></li>
     </ul>
